Heyo!
If you are reading this, this means you are very lost, or just very bored.

In this repo i dump all my simulations and or side projects regarding my project "Zitteraal",
which includes building a fully functional Linear Lorentz Accelerator (Railgun! Wohoo!) on a budget.

I am always happy if people want to help me or just improve my code / sims, thus I can learn new things :)
For updates on the build, visit my LinkedIn (i post there sometimes)

cheerio xo
